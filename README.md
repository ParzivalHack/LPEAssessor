LPEAssessor is a comprehensive Linux privilege escalation assessment tool designed for security professionals, system administrators, and penetration testers. It systematically identifies potential privilege escalation vectors, verifies their exploitability, and provides detailed reports with actionable remediation recommendations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Detects 12+ types of privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- **Real-time Verification**: Verifies vulnerabilities to minimize false positives
- **Advanced Exploitation**: Generates practical exploitation commands with multiple approaches
- **Path Hijacking Analysis**: Sophisticated path manipulation vulnerability detection
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: Optional monitoring for privileged execution of hijacked binaries
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML, JSON, and text reports
- **Threading Support**: Multithreaded scanning for improved performance
- **System Compatibility**: Works across various Linux distributions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LPEAssessor.git
cd LPEAssessor

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

```
# Basic scan with default options
python lpeassessor.py

# Generate a report in all formats (HTML, JSON, text)
python lpeassessor.py -o report

# Verbose output with custom log file
python lpeassessor.py -v -l assessment.log

# Increase number of scanning threads
python lpeassessor.py -t 20

# Skip information gathering and exploit generation
python lpeassessor.py --skip-info --skip-exploits

# Monitor for successful path hijacking exploits
python lpeassessor.py --monitor-only --monitor-timeout 600
```
